Description: GPU-accelerated Illumina sequencing demultiplexer
 CUDA-Demux is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated tool for demultiplexing
 Illumina sequencing data from BCL/CBCL format to FASTQ files. It leverages
 CUDA for fast barcode matching and parallel processing.
 .
 Features:
  - GPU Acceleration for fast barcode matching
  - CBCL Support for NovaSeq and NextSeq platforms
  - Multi-threaded BCL/CBCL file parsing
  - Dual indexing support
  - High performance processing of billions of reads
